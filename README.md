üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Flutter SDK installed (version 3.x or higher)

A code editor like VS Code or Android Studio

A Supabase account (free tier)

A Cloudinary account (free tier)

Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git)
cd YOUR_REPO

2. Install Dependencies

flutter pub get

3. Set up Supabase

Go to your Supabase Dashboard and create a new project.

In your project, go to the SQL Editor and run the query from the database.sql file (or the queries provided in the development history) to create the issues table.

Go to Project Settings > API. Copy your Project URL and anon public Key.

In lib/main.dart, replace the placeholder values with your Supabase credentials:

await Supabase.initialize(
url: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL',
anonKey: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY',
);

4. Set up Cloudinary

Go to your Cloudinary Dashboard.

Find your Cloud Name on the dashboard.

Go to Settings (gear icon) > Upload.

Scroll down to Upload presets, click "Add upload preset".

Change the "Signing Mode" from "Signed" to "Unsigned" and save. Copy the Upload preset name.

In lib/app/services/cloudinary_service.dart, replace the placeholder values:

class Secrets {
static const cloudName = 'YOUR_CLOUD_NAME';
static const uploadPreset = 'YOUR_UPLOAD_PRESET_NAME';
}

5. Configure Location Permissions

Follow the instructions in the geolocator and flutter_map package documentation to set up the necessary permissions for Android and iOS. This involves editing AndroidManifest.xml and Info.plist.
